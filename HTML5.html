    <p>JavaScript is NOT the same as Java.  Please note the following:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Java is an OOP programmging language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language.</li><br/>
        <li>Java creates applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser only.</li><br/>
        <li>Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text.</li><br/>
        <li>They require different plug-ins.</li>
      </ul>

    <article>JavaScript is the programming language of HTML and the Web.
      Programming makes computers do what you want them to do.
      JavaScript is easy to learn. Let's explore the resources that are out there.

  </section>
  <aside>It is my perception that learning JS will be like learning any new language.  Although there will be the fundamentals to learn, I'm sure it will become more complex as our program continues.  For those that are familiar with other programming languages, I presume that the learning curve will not be as steep relative to those that truly are starting from no programming experience. <br/><br/>
  Resources abound and what is the "best" one is difficult to determine. If anyone is willing to share thoughts and concerns, please let us know in class.
  That would most greatly appreciated.
